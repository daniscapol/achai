    "content": "# Getting Started with MCP Servers\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through setting up your first MCP server with Claude.\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. With MCP, you can extend Claude's capabilities to interact with databases, APIs, files, and more.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started, you need to install Claude Code CLI:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @anthropic/claude-code\n```\n\n## Adding an MCP Server\n\nOnce installed, you can add an MCP server using the following command:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add server-name /path/to/server\n```\n\n## Using MCP Servers\n\nAfter adding an MCP server, you can start using it in your conversations with Claude. Here's an example:\n\n```\nUser: Use the postgres MCP server to query my database\nClaude: I'll help you query your PostgreSQL database using the MCP server...\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you've set up your first MCP server, you might want to:\n\n1. Explore our catalog of available MCP servers\n2. Learn how to develop your own MCP server\n3. See advanced usage patterns for MCP"
